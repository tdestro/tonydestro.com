						<h2 id="hAboutTheFund">About the Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund</h2>
						<p>Sight is one of our most valued senses.  Many of our most cherished memories and important life lessons are acquired through our sight.</p>
						<p>At Transitions Optical, we believe that it is no longer good enough just to correct vision.  To have truly Healthy Sight, vision should be optimized for today and protected for the future.  This commitment is reflected in our corporate vision:</p>
						<h2 id="hInEveryLight">Healthy Sight in Every Light</h2>
						<p>In the spirit of this vision, and to help ensure more people understand how to achieve Healthy Sight, we established the Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund.</p>

							<h3 id="hLearnFrom">How Much Do You Learn From What You See?</h3>
							<p>The majority of knowledge we have about the world around us comes through our eyes.</p>
							<p>Proper vision care and vision wear should be established in childhood, when a lifetime of learning begins.  Kids with undetected vision problems can suffer from low self-esteem, frustration, poor literacy or physical side effects &ndash; like headaches.  Sometimes, they are wrongly viewed as &ldquo;slow learners.&rdquo;</p>
							<p class="pStats">1 in 4 children has an undetected vision problem</p>
                            <p>With quality eyecare and the right eyewear, most children can see to their full potential, enabling them to visually experience the joys of childhood and better prepare for the future.</p>

							<p>Vision problems can cause difficulty reading, trouble seeing the blackboard, frustration or low self-esteem, redness or tearing of the eyes and headaches.</p>

							<!-- vision glare flash piece -->
							<h4 id="hGlare">Glare</h4>
							<p>Reflections off of objects (like a computer screen) or eyeglass lenses themselves can also be distracting, reducing vision and causing eye fatigue.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<h3 id="hSeeingYourBest">Are You Seeing Your Best?</h3>
							<p>Having Healthy Sight is about more than seeing &ldquo;20/20.&rdquo; There are many factors that affect sight.  Visual needs change as you work, play and experience life, so that even &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; 20/20 vision on an eye chart may be far from &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; in the real world.</p>
							<p>Light is essential to vision, but too much or too little can result in eyestrain, squinting or eye fatigue. Too much light, or &ldquo;glare,&rdquo; decreases the contrast between darks and lights, so it is hard to distinguish one object from another.</p>
							<p class="pStats">Quality of sight can impact performance at school, work or in our everyday lives</p>
							<p>Each of us has unique personal, occupational, social, medical and recreational visual needs. Ask your eyecare professional about vision wear options that are right for you.</p>
						</div>

					<div id="pnlMissSeeing">
						<div class="content">
							<h3 id="hMissSeeing">What Would You Miss Seeing?</h3>
							<p>There are things you can do to today, to protect your sight for tomorrow.  For example, wearing 100% UV-blocking eyewear can help reduce the risk of sight-stealing diseases like cataracts and possibly macular degeneration.  And glaucoma, while potentially blinding, can be effectively managed when caught early.</p>
							<p>The best way to ensure healthy sight for a lifetime is to protect it now!  Even if you aren&rsquo;t experiencing trouble with your vision, comprehensive eye exams can uncover problems before symptoms occur and can even assist in early detection of other serious health problems &ndash; including diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>
							<p class="pStats">Every year 3.2 million people go blind from prolonged UV exposure.</p>
							<p>See your eyecare professional for a regular eye exam, and ask about ways you can optimize your vision today and protect your eyes from UV and injury.</p>

                            <p>A cataract is a clouding of the eye's lens. Of the 20 million people with cataracts, an estimated 20% may be due to UV.</p>

					<h2 id="hAboutTestimonial">Healthy Sight For Life Fund Testimonial from Christine Silva R.D.O.</h2>
					<p>I am an optician and have used your Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund DVD to begin a presentation to my son&rsquo;s elementary school; and it was such a powerful and moving video.  I am proud to be able to educate our children on the importance of taking care of their vision.  The children (fifth to eighth grade) asked many questions regarding lenses and UV protection and much more.  I believe in your product and I recommend it to every patient I encounter.  I know your company is dedicated to educating our children as well as adults about the importance of preserving our vision; and I support you in your efforts. &ndash; Christine Silva R.D.O.</p>

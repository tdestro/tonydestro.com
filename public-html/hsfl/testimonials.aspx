							<p>My five-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Shyanne, was diagnosed with a very rare, terminal illness, called Alstrom&rsquo;s Syndrome.  It has affected our life in so many ways.  It took us a long time to discover Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> lenses, but when we did, we were so happy.  She is almost blind now, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the Transitions lenses she would not be able to see anything.  For this short time that she is able to see all of the beautiful things that this world has to offer, I am so happy that it&rsquo;s with Transitions lenses.  This product has made our lives that much easier.  Thank you.</p>

							<p>I am an optician and have used your Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund DVD to begin a presentation to my son&rsquo;s elementary school; and it was such a powerful and moving video.  I am proud to be able to educate our children on the importance of taking care of their vision.  The children (fifth to eighth grade) asked many questions regarding lenses and UV protection and much more.  I believe in your product and I recommend it to every patient I encounter.  I know your company is dedicated to educating our children as well as adults about the importance of preserving our vision; and I support you in your efforts.</p>

Developed by a family resource specialist, the interactive program involved various stations that children and their parents and teachers visited.  Staff members demonstrated magnifiers and other devices, taught cane travel, simulated vision loss with special glasses and showed adaptive technology, like large-print books and talking items. </p>

							<p>The grant supported the printing of educational handouts for distribution to children, their families and teachers and at school health fairs.  It also provided wraparound sunglasses to protect children&rsquo;s eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays and prevent dust and other objects from entering the eye.  Eighty percent of program participants were prescribed Transitions&reg; lenses for glare reduction and increased comfort in variable lighting conditions.  </p>
							<p>A survey of the children after they received their eyewear revealed that 38% improved the quality of their school work and 27% increased their participation in classroom activities. </p>

							<p>VHI is a U.S.-based, non-profit, volunteer organization dedicated to the delivery of free vision-care services and sight-restoring surgery to the medically underserved populations in Latin America.  </p>
							<p>VHI&rsquo;s one-week field program, Restoring the Gift of Sight to Guatemala: 2008, was made possible exclusively through donations.  The donation from the Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund was used to acquire medical and surgical supplies and to defray other costs, such as shipping, transportation and volunteer expenses.  Over 1,000 patients, some coming on foot and many travelling considerable distances, made their way to the VHI clinic to be seen.  Following an eye examination by an ophthalmologist to determine the extent of vision loss, over 700 pairs of eyeglasses were dispensed and 119 surgeries were performed.  </p>

						<dd id="pnlEDF" class="accordionDetail">
							<p>The &ldquo;Join and See&rdquo; campaign has reached 27,000 Quebec families with school-aged children with the support of the Transitions<sup>&reg;</sup> Healthy Sight for Life Fund.  Through the program, a tour &ndash; spanning 66 primary schools in 16 regions &ndash; serves as a forum to provide children with free vision screenings and remind parents of the importance of annual eye exams and sight-enhancing eyewear at school and at home.</p>
							<p>As a result of the screenings, some children were identified as needing a more thorough eye exam, and parents were notified to schedule an appointment with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.  More than 600 pairs of eyeglasses were distributed to lower-income families identified through the tour in 2008 &ndash; reinforcing the important role that vision wear can play in a child&rsquo;s performance at school.  </p>
